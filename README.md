# first-program

This Python program implements a simple desktop “to‑do” manager using Tkinter (the standard Python GUI toolkit) enhanced by ttkbootstrap (a theming library). It stores tasks in a plain text file, displays them in a sortable table, lets you add/delete/complete tasks (with motivational quotes), toggles between light/dark themes, and shows a live clock with date.
